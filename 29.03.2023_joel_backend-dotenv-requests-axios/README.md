## Making requests in the backend

- Common for integrations
    - This is one of making integrations
    - Frontend sends product search request to backend
    - Backend sends product search request to Product Data Management system
        - PDM responds to backend
        - Backend responds to frontend

- Modern versions of Node can just do Fetch :)
    - We used to have to use a third party tool for this
    - Very commonly "axios"
